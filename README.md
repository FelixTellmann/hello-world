# hello-world

Hello There,

I am Felix!

I'm here to learn coding and to develop my own web based company focussing on helping restaurants manage their employees more effectively.!  Over the next month I am trying to learn as much as possible about the web fundamentals html, css, javascript and combine it with a back-end knowledge about php and mySQL databases to hopefully at the end be able to create a compeltely functional interatice database driven website.

I'm exited to learn as much as possible!
